There may still be bugs and functionality is not guaranteed.__\r\n\r\n__Make sure to update your bookmark, as the link has changed recently!!!__\r\n\r\n__Important changes in version 2.x.x:__\r\n\r\n- Now should be fully compatible with Firefox.\r\n- You can now change the bot's name, no need to make a fork to change it anymore. Available under custom settings as \"botName\".\r\n- The bot's variable is now exposed outside of the script. You can access it as the variable \"bot\" in the console. This should allow for secondary scripts extending the bot without the need to fork and lose support on its basis.\r\nBe careful when extending it to make sure commands or features interact properly with the rest of them.\r\nAn example script to extend the bot is provided under exampleExtension.js. Please do not fork this repository to just change that file. Details of how to use are provided inside.\r\nThis is NOT needed to run the bot as it is provided, only if you want to add functionality.\r\n- Command checking has been reworked to facilitate adding commands through secondary scripts as explained above.\r\n- __There is now support for custom chat messages. This means you can use your own custom wording or translate it into your own language.__\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBookmark the following code. To run the bot, run the bookmark.\r\n\r\n`javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://rawgit.com/Yemasthui/basicBot/master/basicBot.js');})();`\r\n\r\nIf this does not work, go to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yemasthui/basicBot/master/basicBot.js and copy paste its content into your console (accessible in chrome by pressing f12) when on plug.dj in your community.\r\n\r\n###Commands###\r\n\r\nThese can be found in [the commands file](https://github.com/Yemasthui/basicBot/blob/master/commands.md).\r\n\r\n###Blacklists###\r\nExamples of blacklists can be found in [the customization repository](https://github.com/Yemasthui/basicBot-customization/tree/master/blacklists).\r\nYou can add blacklists in the settings of the bot via the methods given in that same repository. See below for more information.\r\n\r\n###Extending functionality and custom default settings###\r\n\r\nbasicBot can be customized to fit your needs. Please refer to [the customization repository](https://github.com/Yemasthui/basicBot-customization) for more info.\r\nPlease do not try to if you are not confident in your javascript capabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Translations###\r\n\r\nOfficial translations will be supported. Available ones can be found under [the language folder](https://github.com/Yemasthui/basicBot/blob/master/lang/langIndex.json). You can set a language in the room settings.\r\nYou can use your own translation or wording by translating the values of in [the English pack](https://github.com/Yemasthui/basicBot/blob/master/lang/en.json) and uploading it to a public hosting service. Put the link into your custom room settings, under chatLink.\r\n\r\n__When translating the chat messages, please note that it is a json format, meaning it is structured as ```\"key\":\"value\"```, please only translate the \"value\" parts, and leave anything between %% (eg. %%NAME%%) as is, they are variables that get filled in by the bot.__\r\n\r\n\r\n###Command Autocomplete Plugin###\r\n\r\n[![Command Autocomplete](http://i.imgur.com/hBMuB5F.png)](https://github.com/ExtPlug/advanced-autocomplete)\r\n\r\nCheck out [this](https://github.com/ExtPlug/advanced-autocomplete) helpful command autocomplete browser plugin by [goto-bus-stop](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) made to work with basicBot's commands.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\nI would like to thank the following people:\r\n\r\n- Fungus: His Tastybot has been a source of inspiration for most of the features, and his help with coding problems has been invaluable to make this bot.\r\n- TAT, Origin and other Litebot contributors: Their Litebot has inspired features like Roulette.\r\n- Henchman: Never knew this undertaking would give me a friend too.\r\n\r\n|Language | Translator|\r\n|:------:|:---------:|\r\n|Portuguese|[Motel Bible](https://github.com/motelbible)|\r\n|French|[NDA](https://github.com/NDAthereal)|\r\n\r\n(I would also like to thank everyone who contributed in translating the bot via the [translation centre](http://translate.benzi.io/admin/collaborators))\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCopyright &copy; 2014 Yemasthui\r\n\r\nModifications (including forks) of the code to fit personal needs are allowed only for personal use and should refer back to the original source.\r\nThis software is not for profit, any extension, or unauthorised person providing this software is not authorised to be in a position of any monetary gain from this use of this software.
